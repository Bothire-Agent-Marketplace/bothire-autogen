Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes except for Flask views.

Organize code with Flask Blueprints and application factories for modularity and testability.

Use type hints for all function signatures and descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active).

Handle errors early with guard clauses and custom error handlers; avoid deeply nested if statements.

Use Marshmallow for serialization/validation and Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication.
